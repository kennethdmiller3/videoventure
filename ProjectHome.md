Videoventure is an exercise in using modern techniques to achieve old-school gaming satisfaction.  The application framework is built around component database system that encourages a flexible, data-driven approach to game entities. It uses quite a few support libraries:
  * [TinyXML-2](http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml2/index.html) to read and write files
  * [FastDelegate](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cpp/FastDelegate.aspx) for delegates and callbacks
  * [GLFW](http://glfw.sourceforge.net/) for setup, window creation, and input handling
  * [BASS](http://www.un4seen.com/) for sound and music
  * [OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org/) for rendering
  * [Chipmunk](http://chipmunk-physics.net/) Game Dynamics for physics and collision
  * [OGLConsole](http://oglconsole.sourceforge.net/) as inspiration for the in-game console.

A surprisingly modest number of components yield a disproportionate amount of time-wasting, pixel-smashing, arcade-style fun.  Of course, the more components the merrier...

Videoventure is set in a world of video games long past.  Your character is not a _guy piloting a spaceship_.  Your character is not a _spaceship_.  Your character is a _video-game sprite of a spaceship_.
